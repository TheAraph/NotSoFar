The "NotSoFar" app is a personal project I am currently developing to bridge the distance in a long-distance relationship. This exercise (apart from solving a real-world problem) is allowing me to improve my skills in mobile app development, user interface design, and my proficiency in creating solutions that are both functional and emotionally resonant. It represents not just technical expertise, but also a deep understanding of user needs and the ability to translate those into a tangible, engaging product.
